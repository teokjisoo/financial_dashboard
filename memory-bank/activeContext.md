# Active Context

## Current Focus
Initial memory bank setup and documentation of the project structure and state.

## Recent Changes
- Created `memory-bank` directory.
- Populated `projectbrief.md` for project overview.
- Populated `productContext.md` for product vision.

## Active Decisions
- **Documentation Strategy**: Implementing a "Memory Bank" approach to ensure project context is maintained across sessions.
- **Backend**: Using a single `server.js` file for the Express server to handle API requests and caching.
- **Frontend**: Utilizing Svelte for a reactive, component-based UI.
- **Data Fetching**: Implementing fallback mechanisms for financial data sources (Alpha Vantage -> Yahoo Finance) to ensure data reliability.

## Next Steps
1.  Complete the remaining memory bank files: `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`.
2.  Begin addressing any outstanding user requests or bugs (referencing recent conversation history regarding "Tile Issues").
3.  Review `server.js` and frontend components (`App.svelte`, etc.) in more detail if specific features need implementation.
4.  Monitor "Add Tile" functionality based on previous conversation context about visibility and data display issues.
