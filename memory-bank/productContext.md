# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Traditional financial tracking tools can be fragmented, complex, or require multiple platforms to monitor a diverse range of assets (currencies, commodities, stocks). Users need a unified, clean, and accessible dashboard to view the performance of key financial indicators at a glance, especially those relevant to Korean investors (KRW, KOSPI).

## Solution
The Financial Dashboard provides a centralized, web-accessible interface that aggregates data from multiple reliable sources. It simplifies the monitoring process by presenting real-time data in an easy-to-read tile format, supported by historical charts for context.

## User Experience Goals
1.  **Immediacy**: Users should see the most critical information (current price, % change) immediately upon loading the dashboard.
2.  **Clarity**: The UI should be clean, with clear visual indicators (green for positive, red/blue for negative) for market movements.
3.  **Simplicity**: Adding new tracking items should be straightforward and intuitive without complex configuration.
4.  **Responsiveness**: The application should load quickly and provide smooth interactions, even when fetching data from external APIs.

## Core Workflows
1.  **View Dashboard**: User opens the app to see the default set of indicators (USD/KRW, Gold, major indices).
2.  **Inspect Detail**: User clicks on a tile to view more detailed historical charts and data points.
3.  **Add Custom Data**: User inputs a stock symbol to add a new tile to their dashboard for personalized tracking.
4.  **Refresh Data**: User can trigger a refresh to get the latest market data, or the system auto-updates at set intervals.
